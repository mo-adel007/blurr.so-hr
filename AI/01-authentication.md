Implemented a secure authentication system using NextAuth.js with email/password credentials and enhanced security measures.

## Original Prompts
1. Initial setup request for authentication system
2. Request for secure login/registration system
3. Request for protected routes and middleware
4. Request for timing attack protection
5. Request for secure session management

## Features
- User registration with email and password
- Secure login with credentials
- Session management with JWT
- Protected routes with middleware
- Timing attack mitigation
- Secure cookie handling
- Server-side route protection

## Technical Details
- Uses bcrypt for password hashing
- Prisma adapter for database integration
- JWT-based session management
- Custom login/register pages
- Form validation using Zod
- Secure cookie configuration
- Timing attack protection with dummy hashing

## Database Schema
```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
